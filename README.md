I'm following the Hello World Github Guides in this file to take the first steps on this platform.

## Apresentation
My name is Juan Galdino. I'm from Brazil, my age is 20 years and I'm interested in working as a front end developer, because it's a profession I love to study and be.

I'm a begginer student.
