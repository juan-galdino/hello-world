# hello-world
I'm following the Hello World Github Guides to become a better developer.

Now i'm learning how to edit a file in repository. 

My name is Juan Galdino, but only Juan is okay. I'm addicted to many types of art and aspire to be a great front-end developer as well, because it's a profession I love to study and be.

It's time to commit my changes :)
